			<h2>A German institute just broke the solar cell efficiency record with 32.5 percent</h2>
			<p class="description">A tandem solar cell developed by researchers at the Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin (HZB) has converted 32.5 percent of incident solar radiation into electrical energy, a world record.</p>
			<p>The achievement was certified by the European Solar Test Installation (ESTI) in Italy, a university press release said.</p>
			<p>There has been significant success when halide perovskites have been used to make solar cells. However, perovskites are prone to rapid degeneration.</p>
			<p>Therefore, researchers are now working on alternating them with other materials inside a solar cell to increase their life span. These are known as tandem solar cells and hold the promise of being commercially viable.</p>
			<p>According to the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy in the U.S., perovskites have increased the energy conversion efficiency of solar cells from a meager three percent in 2009 to over 25 percent today.</p>
			<p>The researchers of the PV Competence Center (PVComB) and the HySPRINT Innovation lab at the HZB worked together to develop a tandem solar cell to break the world record.</p>
			<p>The researchers put to work an advanced perovskite composition and combined it with an interface modification that helped reduce the charge carrier recombination losses.</p>
            <p>The effects of this modification were studied in-depth and then used to design tandem solar cells which also had optical improvements on them.</p>
            <p>Put together, the improvements made to the design of the solar cell helped it achieve a 32.5 percent energy conversion efficiency, a world record.</p>
