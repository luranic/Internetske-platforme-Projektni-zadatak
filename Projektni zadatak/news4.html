			<h2>Demand for solar installers grows 315% as profession tops ranks for best jobs in 2023</h2>
			<p class="description">Solar has become increasingly economic in recent years, with surging power prices also driving domestic and industrial adoption, and therefore jobs market.</p>
			<p>Over the last three years there's been a 315% increase in the demand for solar installers, according to new data from hiring platform Indeed.</p>
			<p>The profession came out top of the site's rankings of the 20 best jobs in the UK for 2023, which included looking on demand for staff, workplace flexibility and salary.</p>
			<p>It found that the average salary for a solar installer was £33,613, with 16% of them remote working and an average of 87 jobs/1 million of the population.</p>
			<p>While this was the second lowest average salary of the roles to make it into the top 20, the significant increase in demand boosted the profession into the top spot.</p>
			<p>“Indeed's 2023 best jobs list clearly highlights trends within our society,” said Danny Stacy, senior manager, Talent Intelligence at Indeed.</p>
			<p>Beyond solar installers, there was a number of other roles within the sustainability sector that made it into the ranking.</p>
